Do people still use this? Maybe it became cheesy, but i like to use it. 
So heeey, my name is Ana and I am going to do here an old-school blog. I want to register my learning process and some things I am thinking and studying. I am the kind of person who likes to take notes. It's easier to remember when I take notes.

This blog is made with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>. I just push the built files from a separate project to my Github Pages repository, but in the future I want to make this process a little better and more automatized. But for now I like this old school way to publish content on the internet.
